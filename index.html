					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>
						JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
						Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
						operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
						be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
						additional objects; for example:
					</p>
					<li>
						Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
						objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
						For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
						elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
						clicks, form input, and page navigation.
					</li>
					<li>
						Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
						objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
						server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
						database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
						another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
						server.
					</li>
				</article>
				<article id="known">
					<h2>What you should already know</h2>
					<p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
					<li>
						A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web
						(WWW).
					</li>
					<li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
					<li>
						Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one
						of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.
					</li>
				</article>
				<article id="jaj">
					<h2>JavaScript and Java</h2>
					<p>
						JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
						different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
						does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
						JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions
						and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was
						renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
					</p>
					<p>
						JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
						have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have
						to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
						protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
						parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed
					</p>
				</article>
				<article id="hello-world">
					<h2>Hello world</h2>
					<p>
						To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and
						write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
					</p>
					<code>
						function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
						greetMe("World");
					</code>
				</article>
				<article id="var">
					<h2>Variables</h2>
					<p>
						You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
						The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain
						rules.
					</p>
					<p>
						A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
						dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
						Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters
						"A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"
						(lowercase).
					</p>
				</article>
				<article id="dec-var">
					<h2>Declaring variables</h2>
					<p>
						You can declare a variable in three ways: With the keyword var. For
						example,
					</p>
					<code>var x = 42.</code>
					<p>
						This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
						By simply assigning it a value. For example,
					</p>
					<code>x = 42.</code>
				</article>
				<article id="var-sc">
					<h2>Variable scope</h2>
					<p>
						When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
						global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
						current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it
						is called a local variable, because it is available only within that
						function.
					</p>
					<code> if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5 </code>
					<p>
						This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
						ECMAScript 2015.
					</p>
					<code>
						if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
						defined
					</code>
				</article>
				<article id="global">
					<h2>Global variables</h2>
					<p>
						Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web
						pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global
						variables using the window.variable syntax. Consequently, you can
						access global variables declared in one window or frame from another
						window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example,
						if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can
						refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.
					</p>
				</article>
				<article id="constants">
					<h2>Constants</h2>
					<p>
						You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword.
						The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
						identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign
						and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
					</p>
					<code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
					<p>
						A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared
						while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
						The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block
						scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is
						assumed to represent a variable.
					</p>
				</article>
				<article id="dt">
					<h2>Data types</h2>
					<p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
					<li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
					<li>
						null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is
						case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other
						variant.
					</li>
					<li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
					<li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
					<li>String. "Howdy"</li>
					<li>
						Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are
						unique and immutable.
					</li>
